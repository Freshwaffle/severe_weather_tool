This is the prototype of my severe weather forecasting GUI. This is in extremely early development and utilizes Artificial Intelligence Models such as Grok, DeepSeek, GitHub CoPilot, ChatGPT due to this being my first major project.
In the future I aim to add much more functionality and potentially make this a standalone software without the use of AI.
